An LMS is a software system that helps libraries manage their daily operations efficiently. It handles core functions like cataloging library materials, managing the borrowing and returning process (circulation), keeping track of library members (user management), and overseeing the library's collection (inventory management).

A key feature is the Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC), which allows users to search for resources online. Modern LMS often include additional features like generating reports, providing mobile access, integrating with other systems, managing digital resources, and offering self-service options.

Ultimately, an LMS aims to improve efficiency for librarians, enhance the user experience for patrons, ensure accurate record-keeping, and optimize the management of library resources. It's a crucial tool for modern libraries to thrive in today's environment.
